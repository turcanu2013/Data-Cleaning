# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this assignment was to gather and clean a dataset collected from wearable technology. The following fies contain the script to accomplish these tasks as well as a description of the data files, variables, transformations, a walk-through of the script, and a final tidy dataset.

## Files

`CodeBook.md` - This contains a list of all the variables in the clean dataset, the names of the files the original data set was pulled from and the units of the data, and a description of the transformations applied on the original data to produce the final clean data.

`run_analysis.R` - The script of the data retrevial and cleaning as instructed by the assignment. The original data was subsetted to include only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, was assigned a string label for the activities, variables were appropriately named, and the train and test groups were combined into one dataset. 

`Data Cleaning Final Course Project.R` - The script `run_analysis.R` with comments that walk through each step. 

`tidydata.txt` - The final tidy data.
